# project-library

A vanilla JS project getting dynamic content from arrays/objects for the 2nd week project in Technigo React/Redux skillup course.

# The problem

In this challenge I used a structured way of adding functionality using Polya's 4 steps to solve problems.

First, understanding the problem I am trying to solve. Then, writing pseudo-code to detail a plan. Lastly I executed that plan.

I did spend a bit too long on adjusting the design of the page and for the next project, I will divide the work into "must do" and "nice to do" in order for me to take a more concious choice about how much time the project can take.
